Web API that have three different methods that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number.

  - Each one have huge difference in performance and logic while implementing;
  - It is used the System.Diagnostics library to check the time in milliseconds of each execution;

Looking foward to make another methods and enhance the code that is presented. Hope you enjoy the challenge!
